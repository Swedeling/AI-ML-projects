# Speaker Recognition

This project is part of my engineering thesis "Automatic Identity Recognition Using Speech Biometric". The main assumptions of the project include creating the most effective solution that will enable the identification of 34 speakers based on 14 recordings of individual words from each of them.


## [Data Selection](https://github.com/Swedeling/Portfolio/blob/main/SpeakerRecognition/data_selection.ipynb)

The data used during the project implementation comes from the free [Common Voice](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org) database. It is an open source collection of recordings of the human voice in various languages. A database of single-word recordings in English was selected for this project. The words spoken are "zero", "one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six", "seven", "eight", "nine", "yes", "no", "Hey", "Firefox". Such a selection of words is due to the fact that they are universal and most often used for user verification (for example with a PIN code), which is one of the applications of speaker recognition systems.
The entire collection contained 16,285 short recordings of words spoken by various users. Therefore, I decided to standardize and limit them. In this section you can find my data selection process.
